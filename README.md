# Local Recommendations and Travel Package Publishing App

VoyageLK is an android application that provides a platform to promote locally owned tourism 
businesses such as hotels and resorts. It carries the potential to provide a solution to the current 
financial crisis in Sri Lanka. Because of the significant impact caused on the countryâ€™s economy 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, the tourism industry has been affected severely. By offering a 
platform that allows tourists to find information about local hotels and their amenities, 
VoyageLK aims to attract more visitors and expand the contribution to the local economy.

This app will provide users with a comprehensive list of hotels along with their facilities and 
pictures. The main purpose of VoyageLK is to aid tourists to find unique accommodations and 
experiences in Sri Lanka while assisting hotel owners to increase their bookings and sales. The 
tourists can also get an idea about approximate travelling expenses via the travel expense 
calculator implemented in the application. Business owners can list their hotels and facilities 
along with the useful information via the app. 

By promoting these local businesses in an attractive manner, VoyageLK can encourage visitors 
to spend more money in Sri Lanka, which can contribute to generating foreign exchange for the 
country.
